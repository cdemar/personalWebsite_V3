            <p>
              The CIA triad is the three pillars of information security:
              Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Confidentiality</b> keeps one's data private. This implies
                that only authorized users and processes should be able to
                access or modify data.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Integrity</b> means that the data is guarded against improper
                modification or destruction of information. This also ensures
                that the information is genuine and can't be denied by the
                sender or receiver.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Availability</b> allows data to be accessed reliably in a
                timely fashion by authorized users to use and obtain.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              On its own, each one could be seen as an important piece of the
              puzzle. However, to fully see the picture one must first put each
              piece together (why it's called the triad). When that is
              accomplished the infosec team has this foundation to go off of,
              they can then know what frameworks and policies are needed to
              effectively secure themselves. Though at times there could be
              tensions within the triad that can restrict one another, this will
              ultimately help determine what priorities to start focusing on.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Why is the CIA triad important?</h2>

            <p>
              The CIA triad allows any team to look at something with a
              simple-to-use mental checklist to evaluate what they have compared
              to what is out there in the market or what they plan on developing
              in-house. This checklist will allow anyone to look at what matters
              most: the validity of the company compared to the most
              cost-effective option. This can be done by looking at the triad
              and asking questions like: Will this platform allow our
              data/assets to be more secure? Can we rely on this service to
              ensure data integrity? Will upgrading our infrastructure make data
              more accessible?
            </p>

            <p>
              The security team's primary responsibility is to evaluate the
              business needs to effectively mitigate the risk of what the bad
              actors (black hat) are trying to do. Doing this helps them do
              their secondary responsibility of making the company money. This
              could be accomplished by knowing the triad and evaluating what
              matters most for the company. If their company deals in healthcare
              they may need to comply with
              <a
                href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/laws-regulations/index.html"
                target="_blank"
              >
                HIPPA</a
              >. However, looking at an e-commerce company focusing on the same
              level of security may be detrimental for them since they would
              care more about ensuring that they follow the
              <a
                href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/standards/"
                target="_blank"
              >
                PCI DSS</a
              >. Also, if looking at the level of complexity of the types of
              hardware and software needed is different. So being mindful about
              the triad regarding hardware and software is necessary to avoid
              wasting company resources.

            <p>
              When looking at these concepts imagine a three-legged stool. If it
              only has two legs then isn't a fully functional product. If the
              legs aren't the same height whoever sits on it will have to be
              mindful of the shorter leg(s) to constantly compensate when
              sitting. Finally, with three uniform legs, you still need to be
              mindful of who the intended user(s) of the stool is for because it
              could still be unsuitable due to its height.
            </p>

            <p>
              Let's now look at an example of how the healthcare industry and
              e-commerce of companies in mind.
            </p>

            <h4 class="section-header">Healthcare industry</h4>

            <p>Think about a situation where someone needs medication:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                When contacting the doctor they want <b>confidentiality</b> of
                the conversation. The security team wants authorized users to
                use two-factor authentication: something you know [i.e.
                password], something you have [i.e. smart card], and something
                about you [i.e. fingerprint].
              </li>
              <li>
                Retrieving medication requires <b>integrity</b>, so there is no
                doubt that the prescription is unaltered.
              </li>
              <li>
                The <b>availability</b> log on to get the medication prescribed,
                ordered, and retrieved is essential.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="section-header">E-Commerce</h4>

            <p>Let's imagine someone is creating an e-commerce website:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Customer data is the simplest idea to highlight the need for
                <b>confidentiality</b>. To keep their trade secrets and other
                data from being leaked.
              </li>
              <li>
                When thinking of <b>integrity</b> they want to make sure the
                custom product is tailored correctly. Also, internally, ensuring
                the availability of said item to be actually in stock.
              </li>
              <li>
                The need for <b>availability</b> means that customers can log
                into the website reliably. Internally, consider that third-party
                services (i.e. payment gateways, APIs) should have both high
                availability and fallback mechanisms for critical third-party
                integrations.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              These are sample examples of how the triad can be practically
              applied. There are several more for each leg, and if you have
              specific needs, you can
