                Center for Internet Security&reg; (CIS)
              </a>
              was established in 2013 by a team of experts from various
              backgrounds and positions to create, adopt, and support the CIS
              Controls. These experts not only discuss what to add and exclude
              from the previous version but also use data to substantiate their
              claims via a platform called the
              <a
                href="https://www.cisecurity.org/insights/white-papers/cis-community-defense-model"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"
                >Community Defense Model (CDM)</a
              >. However, before obtaining this data, they initially used a
              standard list of publicly known attacks as a simple and informal
              test to evaluate the usefulness of specific recommendations.
            </p>

            <p>
              When creating this version of the framework, the team of experts
              wanted to establish a strong foundation based on a set of design
              principles. These principles provide the experts with a unified
              focus to deliver the best possible framework for us to implement
              in our security. The principles used by the team are as follows:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                <b>Offense Informs Defense</b>: This principle leads the team to
                prioritize controls based on the data showing how attackers are
                currently behaving.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Focus</b>: The team focuses on identifying critical attacks
                and helps us avoid unnecessary tasks.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Feasible</b>: The team ensures that the safeguards suggested
                are specific and practical to implement.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Measurable</b>: This principle ensures that the safeguards
                are clearly defined and easy to understand.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Align</b>: The controls and safeguards suggested align with
                other governance, regulatory, and process management schemes,
                frameworks, and structures.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              These principles are very useful for anyone who wants to start
              implementing security measures. Other frameworks may be more
              flexible to accommodate different company needs, but they lack the
              focus that these principles provide. Once you have established
              this focus and put measurable defenses in place, you can move on
              to other frameworks such as NIST, CSA, SAFECode, OWASP, HIPAA,
              SOC, PCI-DSS, and GDPR to further enhance your security.
            </p>

            <p>
              The CIS Critical Security Controls v8 framework comprises 18
              controls with 153 sub-controls. Additionally, there are three
              Implementation Groups that provide safeguards to protect an
              organization’s digital landscape.
            </p>

            <h4 class="section-heading">Implementation Group 1 (IG1)</h4>
            <p>
              IG1 is designed for small to medium-sized companies, including
              those that use commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and
              software. It has only 56 sub-controls and is suitable for
              companies that lack technical personnel. IG1 is an ideal starting
              point for building a strong security foundation. It can also be
              useful for companies that do not hold critical data which could
              lead to a loss of trust if a breach occurs.
            </p>

            <h4 class="section-heading">Implementation Group 2 (IG2)</h4>
            <p>
              IG2 uses all 56 sub-controls from IG1 and adds 74 more. Companies
              that have either implemented all of IG1’s controls or have
              sensitive client or enterprise information that can still
              withstand short interruptions of service should start with IG2.
              Additionally, companies that have a major concern about losing
              public confidence due to a breach should also consider IG2.
              Certain safeguards in IG2 may require enterprise-grade technology
              and specialized expertise to configure and install.
            </p>

            <h4 class="section-heading">Implementation Group 3 (IG3)</h4>
            <p>
              IG3 is for companies that have outgrown IG2. These companies may
              have assets and data containing sensitive information or functions
              that are subject to regulatory and compliance oversight and must
              address the availability of services, and the confidentiality and
              integrity of sensitive data. Successful attacks on such companies
              can cause significant harm to the public welfare. IG3 includes all
              the sub-controls of IG1 and IG2, along with 23 additional
              controls.
            </p>

            <p>
              The CIS Critical Security Controls v8 framework is not a
              definitive endpoint but a strategic launchpad that helps fortify
              digital landscapes. It emphasizes the importance of understanding,
              prioritizing, and implementing security measures that align with
              evolving threat landscapes. Security is not merely a checklist; it
              requires an ongoing commitment to protecting the integrity and
              confidentiality of data and assets. As we navigate the
              complexities of the digital realm, the CIS Controls will guide us
              in establishing a resilient defense that adapts and grows
              alongside dynamic cybersecurity challenges.
