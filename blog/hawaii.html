              Arriving in Honolulu around 10:30 in the morning allowed us to
              experience another amazing first day while also relaxing due to
              having to wake up early to make our flight. While having to wait
              for our Airbnb we knew we had some things we wanted to do that
              wouldn't cause us to deal with our luggage, though minimal still
              troublesome, we went to
              <a
                href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/lulus-waikiki-honolulu?osq=lulu"
                target="_blank"
                >Lulu Waikiki</a
              >
              for their delicious Loco Moco. Afterward, since we had to wait
              about two hours till check-in, we went to, one of the many, ABC
              stores for the obligatory picking up of souvenirs for family and
              friends, to our tech to Starbucks to relax the rest of the time
              while also having the beautiful sights of the ocean. When we were
              able to check in and meet our host we stayed in the room a bit to
              recharge before conquering the rest of the day. After rejuvenating
              we checked out an amazing sunset and then decided it was finally
              time to have some dinner. Being the foodies we are, we wanted to
              experience as many local places as possible started our mission at
              <a
                href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/waikiki-brewing-company-honolulu"
                target="_blank"
                >Waikiki Brewing Company</a
              >
              and had their poki bowl and a sampler flight of their beer. We
              then went to
              <a
                href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/izakaya-tako-no-ki-honolulu"
                target="_blank"
                >Izakaya Tako-No-Ki</a
              >
              and got some delicious Hamachi Poke (Yellow Tail), Miso Soup, and
              Butatama. We even said we might have to check them out again to
              try the Asari Miso Soup just because it has clams in it and that
              sounds interesting. The final place we went to end it off with was
              a food truck place near our place called
              <a
                href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/blue-ocean-seafood-and-steak-honolulu"
                target="_blank"
                >Blue Ocean Seafood and Steak</a
              >
              food trucks and got some mahi-mahi and lamb shanks and some
              fresh-cut pineapple for dessert.
            </p>

            <p>
              On our second day, we had breakfast at
              <a
                href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/marukame-udon-honolulu"
                target="_blank"
                >Marukame Udon</a
              >. They serve the same thing all day so if you want to eat there
              without having to wait in a long line go in the morning. After we
              had breakfast we booked a
              <a
                href="https://gohawaiitours.com/oahu-tours/oahu-circle-island-tour-with-turtle-snorkeling/"
                target="_blank"
                >tour</a
              >
              around the island for the next day. For lunch, we walked from the
              strip up to
              <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_Head,_Hawaii"
                target="_blank"
                >Diamond Head</a
              >
              and brought our lunch from
              <a
                href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/musubi-cafe-iyasume-honolulu"
                target="_blank"
                >Musubi Cafe Iyasume</a
              >. If you plan on walking to Diamond Head from the cafe it will
              take you approximately two hours. However, if you want to take the
              bus you could take the number 2 line and that cut an hour from the
              trip. After coming back to the room we rested a bit and then went
              and spent some time swimming in the ocean. Before we had our main
              dinner meal we went to
              <a
                href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/hula-dog-kuhio-honolulu"
                target="_blank"
                >Hula Dog Kuhio</a
              >
              and
              <a
                href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/ice-cream-rolls-hawaii-honolulu"
                target="_blank"
                >Ice Cream Rolls Hawaii</a
              >
              since we missed them the night before. The bacon taro bun is
              amazing and the Polish sausage with any of the toppings is just
              plain amazing. After we ate at Lulu's for our second dinner and
              had their chicken wings, salmon plate, and an okay Mai Tai.
            </p>

            <p>
              On the third day, we had to wake up early because our tour bus was
              going to pick us up at 7:20 am so we had breakfast and something
              to wake us up at
              <a
                href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/kai-coffee-alohilani-resort-waikiki-beach-honolulu-2?osq=Kai+Coffee+Hawai%27i"
                target="_blank"
                >Kai Coffee Alohilani Resort Waikiki Beach</a
              >. After we had an amazing time on the trip with our tour guide
              Jay and he made the experience even better. The lunch was one of
              many highlights besides actually being able to see a turtle and a
              monk seal. After getting back we splurged again for another
              amazing dinner experience. We knew one place we wanted to check
              out again was the Hula Dog Kuhio place and this time had one dog
              each. We also learned that they have a rewards sticker card and I
              feel if we learned about this the night before our mindset of what
              we would have had for dinner would have been different. We then
              were trying to find
              <a
                href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/moo-pizza-honolulu"
                target="_blank"
                >Moo Pizza</a
              >
              when we were getting back to our room to drop our stuff off from
              the trip. However, we first found
              <a
                href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/waikiki-beachside-kitchen-honolulu-3"
                target="_blank"
                >Waikiki Beachside Kitchen</a
              >
              and had a mini kalua plate to share. A nice college student was
              working there and we had a great conversation while waiting and
              while eating our meal. Then a block further we found Moo Pizza and
              when asked what the most popular pizza was he said it was the Moo
              Special Pizza, a white sauce pizza with chunks of mozzarella and
              basil, and thus we had to get it and order a small, as I am
              normally not an exodic sauce user, however, we took it to the room
              and was barely able to finish it. After the food coma, we went to
              the Brewery again I tried another flight and meant to buy some
              beer from there but decided to instead get some amazing
              <a
                href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/island-distillers-honolulu-2?osq=moonshine"
                target="_blank"
                >moonshine</a
              >
              which we had to go off the strip itself to find it.
            </p>

            <p>
              On the final day, we had our flight back home at about 11:00 am so
              all we did that day was pack up and have some breakfast at
              Marukame Udon then return home with memories and conversations
              about returning for more Hula Dog Kuhio.
            </p>
